On the filthy metal interior,
Carver’s book lay open on pages
142 and 143.
I’d spotted it while
wiping the dust from my eyes and picked it up.

By this point, I was chewing sand,
and my underwear was riding my backside.
I looked out over the desert
—the sun baking the air—
and for a moment,
I thought I saw the New York skyline.

And then I thought I saw you out there
in that inferno—
almost jumped out to get you.
I would’ve jumped out of that thing to get you, you know?

It would’ve been about six o’clock in the evening
where you were.
I pictured you at home with the dog,
the radio humming softly in the background.

Our ETA was forty-five minutes.
The flight had been a real smoothie so far.

I shut Carver’s book
and stuffed it back into my pack.
Exhaled.

Closing my eyes,
I drifted in and out,
and in and out,
and in and out,

to the roaring hum of the propellers,
holding us high above the dunes—
those red-hot, biblical dunes.
