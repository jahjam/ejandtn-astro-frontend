Take me back
to when the cider was heavy,
and the way was long and unsure.
Take me back
to the days when I kissed
with patience and naive certainty,
those days
when I never wasted a beer.
Take me back
to that bedroom, that first kiss, that feeling.
To when I was her waking thought,
her lunchtime talk,
and her goodnight kiss.
To when I was her first, first love,
introduced to her father
over fish and chips.
Take me back
to the day I spent in high school
that lasted twenty-two years.
To me and Ian Curtis,
holding on for dear life.

Just take me out of this sequence
and back to those hours of my youth
upon the canalâ€™s edge,
where the water was polluted,
but our minds were crystal clear.
