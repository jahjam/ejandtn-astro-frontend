## This here is my website!

The plan is for it to contain everything I've ever made and will make.
This could be music, photography, poetry, stories, soundscapes, and fanzines.

This blog specifically will be to mirror anything written that I post on
[Instagram](https://www.tiktok.com/@e.j.hallows) or [BlueSky](https://bsky.app/profile/ejhallows.bsky.social)
just to keep my own searchable document of it all.

Thanks for visiting and please come back to check in and see what I'm upto
from time to time!

You can follow me on most social media platforms. If you just search E.J. Hallows,
you'll find me!
