      E. J. Mainwaring (the sole member of EJANDTN) writes captivating songs,
      which are brought to life with his unique, rich baritone vocal that
      conjures thoughts of Leonard Cohen and Scott Walker. A singer and
      songwriter born in Liverpool, UK, his music errs on the side of
      melancholia, whilst also still managing to provoke hopeful and nostalgic
      imagery in the process. <br /><br />Usually accompanied by a band of
      accomplished musicians weaving the intricate instrumentation around his
      captivating narratives, James studies and channels the foundations of
      songwriting and storytelling laid out before him by the likes of Bob
      Dylan, Paul Simon and John Lennon. With a passion for songwriting, his
      focus is mainly on deeply thought-out, spellbinding lyrics and moving
      instrumentation to deliver his unique style of song.
